Multi-Language Mini Project

This repository contains small programs in C++, JavaScript, and Python, each demonstrating basic problem-solving concepts.

 Files
Tree1.cpp → Prints a tree/star pattern using loops.  
JavaScript.js → Demonstrates asynchronous programming with Promises and random delays.  
Random.py → Prints numbers up to 100 and stops execution at a random number.  

Tools & Techniques
Languages: C++, JavaScript, Python  
Concepts: Loops, conditions, randomization, asynchronous execution  

Motive
To practice and demonstrate coding skills in multiple languages through small standalone scripts.
